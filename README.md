# Water-Quality-Potability

Data was gathered from https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability and I was working to use various binary classification algorithms and find the most optimal system to detect potable water based on a number of metrics. 

#### Context from Kaggle Website:
"Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions." - (https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability)
